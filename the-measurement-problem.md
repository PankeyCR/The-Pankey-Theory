# 🎯 Measurement Problem

**Status**: Early Draft  
**Role**: Application of static analysis and structural loops to quantum measurement.

### 🧩 Introduction

The quantum measurement problem is one of the central puzzles of physics. In standard terms, it asks how a quantum system with multiple possible outcomes appears to “collapse” into a single observed result.

Within this theory, the measurement problem is understood as a structural interaction. Instead of treating the particle as having a definite path or position before measurement, position is modeled as an **illogical variable** — unresolved until interaction occurs.

### 🧩 Structural Formulation (First Approximation)

- A particle is expressed as a self-loop with unresolved locality:  

`𝚿 = P ⟳ P : (all posible positions)`

- When such a structure interacts with another structure (for example, a screen or an observer), locality must be established. This interaction enforces that the particle *lands somewhere*, though it does not specify in advance which path determines the landing.  

- The waviness observed in experiments is not treated as a property of the particle itself, but as the consequence of unresolved branching paths being collapsed through interaction.

### 🧩 Outlook

The goal of this line of work is to show how **collapse** and **interference** can both be expressed as structural outcomes of illogical loops interacting with other logics. This document serves only as an outline of the approach.  

Further sections will detail:  
- the explicit interaction rules,  
- the role of different observers (physical screens, conscious processes), and  
- the resulting predictions.  

These details are under development and will be added in future versions.
