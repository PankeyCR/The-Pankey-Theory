### üß© Introduction to Static Analysis

Static analysis comes as a need to stop trying to compute an illogic statement. You can drag yourself down the rabbit hole with any illogic and get nowhere. But when you stop the computation, there‚Äôs a chance to see it as it is and have another perspective. This is where this theory comes to be.

Not resolving the illogic is kind of the answer in some sense. The new perspective clarifies that we are talking or thinking about something, but somehow it‚Äôs impossible to resolve it and get a clear answer. So there‚Äôs something about it that makes it not capable of being resolved, so there‚Äôs a structure or form that explains this impossibility of resolution. This gives the idea that illogics are impossible things but still things.

Since illogics have shapes or structure, we can talk about them. And this structure points to an illogic even if we can‚Äôt resolve it.

When you‚Äôre down the rabbit hole thinking about an illogic, and you stop, the train of thought collapses into a structure. This is the process in which static analysis in our brains starts. The collapse of an illogic into a structure is done without time; it‚Äôs actually time that makes us miss the opportunity to see the structure as it is.

The act of simply observing the illogic as it is, is called static analysis.  
One of the ideas of static analysis is to avoid leaking nonsense into the thinking process. All computation has to be done without any illogic. So static analysis freezes the processing of the illogic and takes it as a structure.  

Static analisys doesn¬¥t leak nonsense into the thinking process because it doesn¬¥t take any answer from the illogic, the illogic collapses into a structure and the structure can be analise without the need of an answer.

### üß© What is a Structure

A structure is a pattern of elements, a way of arranging them, and the relationships between them.  

It is the abstract representation of the connections between the elements being discussed.  

A structure must represent the totality of the elements, because it is the realization of what it is. The thing we¬¥re refering must come as a given from the start.

### üß© Types of Structures

There are many ways to build a structure, but there‚Äôs a clear difference when we talk about logical or illogical structures. For either one, there are many ways to construct them.

#### 1. **Illogical Structure**

An illogic cannot be resolved, and to express this notion we use the cyclic structure:

`A ‚ü≥ A`  

This gives an immediate resolution by recognizing the loop symbol that shows that is a never-ending expression.

This structure can be written down with normal math but it does not give the understanding of its unresolvable nature, like the expression:

`A ‚àà A`  

This kind of expression requires us to compute to understand that for every A there‚Äôs an A inside.  
With something this trivial it‚Äôs easy to see in our minds, but for larger expressions it gets harder. That‚Äôs why cyclic structures provide an easy way to know beforehand what we are talking about.

The types of structure come from the ways you can arrange a cycle:

- How many steps it takes to complete a cycle.  
- How many paths it can take.  
- How many return points it has.

All these forms describe different types of illogic.

When a cycle has some steps to be completed, its structure is:

`A ‚ü≥ A : (B ‚àß C)`  

This is read as ‚ÄúA loops to A via B and C.‚Äù The loop can be extended by adding more elements with the ‚Äúand‚Äù symbol.

When the loop takes more than one path, its structure is:

`A ‚ü≥ A : (B ‚à® C)`  

This is read as ‚ÄúA loops to A via B or C.‚Äù The loop can take more paths by adding more elements with the ‚Äúor‚Äù symbol.

When the illogic has multiple cycles, the structure is:

`A ‚ü≥ A ‚äó X ‚ü≥ X`  

This structure has two loops interacting with each other. Its read as ‚ÄúThe interaction between A loops to A and X loops to X.‚Äù You can interact as many structures as you want.  

Then it comes the conditions that a structure can have. This specifies the internal elements of a structure.  

`A ‚ü≥ A | B ‚àà A`  

This is read as ‚ÄúA loops to A with the condition that B belonges to A‚Äù. The condition is part of the structure.  

#### 2. **Logical Structure**

`A ‚ñ∑ D`  

`A ‚ñ∑ D : (B ‚à® C)`

### üß© Structural Equality

Static analysis requires a notion of equality that does not depend on computation. When you use **bijection** (one-to-one correspondence) for equality, you¬¥re hiding a computational assumption. In contrast, static analysis uses **recognition of form** to determine equality between structures.

#### 1. Bijection and Computation

Two collections are considered equal in size if there exists a bijection ‚Äî a one-to-one correspondence between their elements. This is treated as a ‚Äústatic‚Äù condition, because no explicit computation is performed. However, the concept itself comes from an imagined process:  

- You mentally line up elements of one set with elements of another, step by step.  
- Even if the process is never carried out, you assume it is *completed in principle*.  
- This ‚Äúcompleted computation‚Äù erases information about how the structures grow or how they are internally arranged.  

For example, if one structure generates two elements for every one element of another, classical cardinality declares them both countable (‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ). The difference in growth rate is lost because a hypothetical pairing ‚Äúafter infinite steps‚Äù is assumed.  

Bijection is trying to not-compute an already completed computation, this gives rise to an illogic that leaks any disireble result to what comes next.  

#### 2. Recognition of Form

Static analysis does not imagine any process. It inspects the definition of a structure directly:  
- How many independent generators does it contain?  
- What loops or self-references define it?  
- What is its arrangement or pattern at once, without unfolding it step by step?  

Recognition may feel sequential to a human mind ‚Äî because we think one thought after another ‚Äî but the structure itself exists as a whole. Once recognized, no computation is needed to establish its properties.  

#### 3. Comparing Them

- **Bijection:** *‚ÄúCould I, in principle, list and pair these elements one by one?‚Äù*  
  - Relies on the fiction of a completed computation.  
  - Ignores structural differences between types of infinity.  

- **Recognition:** *‚ÄúWhat is the arrangement or form of this structure, right now?‚Äù*  
  - Requires no hypothetical procedure.  
  - Preserves distinctions between structures that classical cardinality collapses.  

Static equality is therefore **form-based, not process-based.** It is determined by recognizing the internal pattern of a structure rather than imagining how an infinite enumeration would behave.

### üß© Cardinality

The cardinality comes from two acts of abstraction. First, you abstract from the nature of the elements. Second, you abstract from the relations between the elements.

The way you specify the abstraction matters in the construction of the structure and its cardinality.  
The nature of the elements can have different meanings: we may be counting different elements, or repetitions of the same element.  
The relation between elements can be an ordered sequence, pairing, or unordered combinations.  
This specification can be recognized immediately in the structure.

If we abstract from the different types of elements and also from the order of the sequence, the cardinality is easy to see in a computational way:

`| A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí D | = 4`  

When the cycle is formed, the cardinality becomes transfinite, but the type of structure determines the different sizes of infinity.

`| A ‚ü≥ A | = ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  
`| A ‚ü≥ A : B | = 2‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  
`| A ‚ü≥ A : (B ‚àß C) | = 3‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  

This is how countable cycles grow in cardinality. Since the loop takes more to complete, the growth is bigger. It may seem that these have the same size as the natural numbers, but the natural numbers can only be constructed as a trivial loop and not as something more complex.

`A ‚àà A ~ A ‚ü≥ A`  

And if A is a unit:  

`A = 1`  

Then A loops to A contains all units that can be, and the cardinality is ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ.  
The structure of A loops to A completely defines the cardinality of ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ in a static way ‚Äî no computational construction can express the never-ending nature of this infinity.

To explain why addition or multiplication of cardinality works this way, we clarify the meaning. We abstract from order, but especially from the nature of the elements. If we make a structure containing chickens, ducks, and the container itself, we now have an infinite sequence of three distinct types. This is represented as 3‚ÇÄ, so there are three times as many transfinite elements:

`A ‚ü≥ A ‚àß (B ‚àß C) ‚àà A = 3‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  

We can also define cardinality for other types of structures:

`| A ‚ü≥ A : (B ‚à® C) | = 2‚ÇÄ^‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  
`| A ‚ü≥ A : (B ‚à® C ‚à® D) | = 3‚ÇÄ^‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`  

These are uncountable loops because there is no order in which they can loop, and their totality is bigger than ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ but not bigger than X‚ÇÄ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ, where X‚ÇÄ is any value except ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ (which would define a different type of structure).

Static analysis gives a direct way to analyze transfinite operations by structure. When you create a cycle, you have already set a transfinite structure, and its infinity is fixed by the eternal loop. Adding more elements makes that eternal loop structurally larger, without any need for computation.
