# ðŸŒŒ Origin of the Universe

**Status**: Draft  
**Role**: Initial outline of how the universe may have emerged within the framework of illogics and logics.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Beginning

The universe is considered to have begun at the moment when **existence itself arose**.  
This marks the transition from pure illogic into partial logic â€” the first collapse that gave rise to reality as we know it.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Forces as Collapsed Logics

The known forces of nature are understood here as the outcomes of **illogic interactions collapsing into logics**:  
- Gravity  
- Electromagnetism  
- Weak nuclear force  
- Strong nuclear force  

Each force represents a stabilized pattern emerging from collisions of illogic structures.

## ðŸ”¹ Sequence Unknown

At this stage, it is not yet determined whether all forces arose simultaneously or in sequence.  
What is clear is that the birth of each force required a distinct collapse or interaction.

## ðŸ”¹ Next Steps

The full process of emergence â€” how each force originated, in what order, and by what interactions â€” will require the formal development of interaction rules.  
Once interactions are fully defined, this model can be expanded into a detailed account of the universeâ€™s first moments.
