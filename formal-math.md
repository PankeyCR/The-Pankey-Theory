### 🧮 Core Operations

#### 1. **Static Entities**

#### Example 1: Invalide Reference

`A ¬= A`  
Invalidates a state

#### Example 2: Direction destruction

`A ∈ B ∧ B ∈ A`  
Destroys the direction in which it can tend to

---

#### 2. **Dynamic Construction**

#### Example 1: Simple Construction

`A → B`  
Means A tends to B through a dynamic process. B is the generated output.

#### Example 2: Single Path Construction

`A → B → C → D`  
Means A tends to D and passes through B and C sequentially. D is the output.

#### Example 3: Multiple Path Construction

`A → B → D ∧ A → C → D`  
Means A tends to D but it goes through B and C in parallele. D is the output.

#### Example 4: Simple Loop Construction

`A → B → A`  
This defines a constructive cycle between A and B and back to A. It is a **potential loop**—infinite and non-terminal.

#### Example 5: Larger Loop Construction

`A → B → C → A`  
Means A loops to A but it goes through B and C sequentially until it circles back to A. No resolution.

#### Example 6: Multiple Path Loop Construction

`A → B → A ∧ A → C → A`  
Means A loops to A but it goes through B and C in parallele until it circles back to A. No resolution.

---

#### 3. **Translation into Static**

#### Example 1: Simple Translation 

`A → B ~ A ▷ B`  
This is a **static outcome**. No cycle is implied.

#### Example 2: Single Path Translation

`A → B → C → D ~ A ▷ D : (B ∧ C)`  
Means A becomes D via B and C.

#### Example 3: Multiple Path Translation

`A → B → D ∧ A → C → D ~ A ▷ D : (B ∨ C)`   
Means A becomes D via B or C.

#### Example 4: Simple Loop Translation

`A → B → A ~ A ⟳ A : B`  
This becomes a **loop structure**, statically defined as “A loops to A via B.”

#### Example 5: Larger Loop Translation

`A → B → C → A ~ A ⟳ A : (B ∧ C)`  
Means A loops to A via B and C.

#### Example 6: Multiple Path Loop Translation

`A → B → A ∧ A → C → A ~ A ⟳ A : (B ∨ C)`  
Means A loops to A via B or C.

#### 4. Structural Equality

Use `≣` to compare static constructs:

`A ▷ D : ( B ∧ C ) ≣ W ▷ Z : ( X ∧ Y )` 
`A ⟳ A : B ≣ C ⟳ C : D` 
- True if structures are form-identical.
- Applies only after translation; structure-only, not resolution-based.

#### 5. **Transfinite algebra**

`ℵ₀ + 2₀ ⋅ ℵ₀ = 3₀ ⋅ ℵ₀`
