## 📌 Overview

The Pankey Theory is a formal framework for constructing, classifying, and analyzing paradoxes, impossibilities, and collapse structures in a static (non-computational) foundation.

Instead of rejecting contradictions, it treats them as first-class objects of analysis. Using a symbolic language and axiomatic system, this theory explores how structures that are logically impossible can still have form, interact, and produce real, logical outcomes.

This is not just a reformulation of logic. It is a meta-framework beyond logic, showing how illogics can coexist, collide, and collapse into reality.

## 📚 Reading Pathway

To understand The Pankey Theory in a structured way, follow this path:

1. **Principles and Philosophy**   - theory.md
   
   Explains why illogics are treated as a constructible object, why static analysis is required, and why this theory does not "explain everything" but frames everything.

2. **Axiom System**   - axioms.md
   
   The formal foundation:
   - The axiom of inevitable conclusion
   - The existence of `Ω`, the ultimate impossibility
   - Logic and hiden structures

3. **Formal Language & Static Structures** - formal-math.md
   
   The grammar and symbolic system:
   - Dynamic vs. Static construction
   - Translation operator
   - Static Equality
   - Collapse Operator

Once those foundations are understood, other modules can be understood coherently.

## 🧠 Goal

The ultimate goal is to create a mature formal system that classifies illogics, defines their interactions, and explains how reality emerges from illogic.
