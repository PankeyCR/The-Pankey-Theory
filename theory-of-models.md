# ðŸŒ€ Theory of Models

**Status**: Early Draft  
**Role**: Clarifies how the Pankey Theory generates models of reality.

### ðŸ§© Introduction

The Pankey Theory is not presented as a closed description of all reality. It is a framework that accepts its own limits. Through static analysis, it becomes clear that **illogics cannot be computed**. Beyond the universe lies only illogic, and while we can describe their **interactions**, we cannot fully resolve or calculate them.  

This limitation does not weaken the theory â€” it defines its proper role. The Pankey Theory is therefore a **meta-theory**: it provides the tools to **create models** of phenomena in the universe.

### ðŸ§© What is a Model?

A **model** is a structured description of some part of reality, built using the language of the theory (loops, conditions, interactions).  

- A model does not claim to explain *everything*.  
- It isolates some variables or attributes of reality.  
- It encodes these variables into structures.  
- It uses interaction rules to generate outcomes.  

If the outcomes of the model match observed phenomena, the model is valid for that domain. Models can also make **new predictions** that can be tested.

### ðŸ§© Why Models are Needed

Static analysis sets a **boundary**: it stops computation and captures structures. Beyond that, full resolution is impossible.  
To proceed, we must construct **models** that approximate reality in partial, testable ways.  

- Not every aspect of reality requires its own model, but it is often practical to divide phenomena into domains.  
- Eventually, multiple domains can be integrated into a **larger model**.  
- In principle, the Pankey Theory can **engloble everything we know**, but new phenomena may always arise, demanding new models.

### ðŸ§© Outlook

The Pankey Theory provides a **method** to construct theories, not just one single theory of nature.  
- Each model applies the same structural principles.  
- Together, models extend our understanding of the universe.  
- The challenge is that reality may always surprise us with new illogics and interactions.  

The **Theory of Models** ensures that whenever this happens, we already have the framework to build new descriptions, integrate them, and expand our knowledge.
