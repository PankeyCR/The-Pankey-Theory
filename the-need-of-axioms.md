# 📑 The Need of Axioms

**Status**: Draft  
**Role**: Clarify why axioms are indispensable in the framework of illogics.

## 🔹 Why Axioms Are Needed Here

This theory deals directly with **illogics** — structures that resist resolution.  
Illogics cannot be computed without risk: if we try to force them into ordinary reasoning, they leak nonsense.  
To prevent this erosion, the theory must anchor certain points not by proof, but by declaration.  
These declarations are the **axioms**.

## 🔹 The Special Role of Axioms with Illogics

- Illogics often generate contradictions when pushed into computation.  
- At the points where a contradiction would spread uncontrolled, the only way forward is to set an axiom.  
- The axiom does not “solve” the illogic; it **contains** it, fixing its role within the structure.  
- In this way, axioms transform what could be destructive nonsense into a stable foundation.

## 🔹 How Axioms Function in the Theory

- **Detection of leaks** — Every place where nonsense could enter must be checked.  
- **Conversion into rule** — If the nonsense cannot be avoided, the spot becomes an axiom.  
- **Consistency check** — If an inconsistency is present *without* being marked as an axiom, the theory is broken.  
- **Legitimacy of paradox** — If the inconsistency *is* marked as an axiom, then it is no longer a flaw but a foundation.

## 🔹 Mapping the Boundary

Axioms in this theory are not optional assumptions; they are the **boundary markers**.  
They identify where reasoning must stop, where no computation is possible, and where the system needs a fixed point.  
By explicitly placing axioms at every such boundary, the theory avoids hidden leaks and keeps its structures coherent.

## 🔹 Conclusion

Every encounter with illogic risks introducing nonsense.  
Axioms are the safeguard: each one is a controlled point of acceptance that blocks uncontrolled spread.  
In this way, axioms both **justify** the system and **protect** it, mapping a path through paradox without being destroyed by it.
