# 🌌 Dark Matter

**Status**: Draft  
**Role**: Outline of how dark matter is understood within the framework of illogic and logic.

---

## 🔹 Concept

Dark matter is taken here as an instance of a **logic–illogic hybrid structure**.  
It displays gravitational effects, yet it avoids all known interactions with electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force.  

---

## 🔹 Logics in Nature

In this framework, the stable forces of nature are seen as **logics**:  
- Gravity is a logic.  
- Electromagnetism is a logic.  
- The weak nuclear force is a logic.  
- The strong nuclear force is a logic.  

Each of these arises as a **collapse of illogic into a defined pattern**.

## 🔹 Dark Matter as Hybrid

Dark matter differs from ordinary matter because it **collapsed only into the logic of gravity**.  
It did not collapse into the logics of electromagnetism, weak, or strong nuclear force.  

The part of its structure that remains unresolved — the **illogic residue** — explains its hidden character.  
This residue is often associated with its “mass,” but in this framework, mass here is partly illogic, not fully logical.

## 🔹 Implication

Dark matter shows that the universe itself allows entities that are neither purely logical nor purely illogical, but **mixed structures**.  
It is evidence that the framework of illogic and logic can describe phenomena where classical physics finds no clear resolution.
